### Version 1: Professional & Concise

```
Subject: Hack the Gap Submission: Recall - AI-Powered Learning System

Hi Hack the Gap Team,

We're excited to submit Recall for your consideration.

**Team**: Recall
**Members**: Diane, Anastasia, Thomas, Hugo

**One-liner**: An AI-powered Zettelkasten system that automatically converts students' passive content consumption into active long-term retention via concept extraction and spaced repetition.

**The Problem**: Students worldwide consume educational content everywhere (YouTube, articles, podcasts) but retain only 15% after two weeks. Gen Z is the first cohort that genuinely cannot power through traditional studying—they need a new retention system.

**Our Solution**: Upload your syllabus, paste YouTube URLs you're already watching, and Recall automatically extracts atomic concepts, matches them to YOUR learning goals, generates flashcards, and schedules spaced repetition reviews. Zero manual work.

**Key Metrics**:
- 🚀 Live at recall.academy
- ⚡ 60-second processing time per video
- 🎯 70%+ concept matching accuracy (MVP)
- 🎴 100% automated flashcard generation
- 📊 Full spaced repetition pipeline functional

**Submission Links**:
- 🌐 Product: https://recall.academy
- 💻 GitHub: https://github.com/hugoganet/hack_the_gap
- 📄 Product & Metrics Doc: [Notion link]
- 🎥 Demo Video: [Video link]

**What Makes Us Different**: We're the only solution that connects what professors require (syllabus), what students actually consume (YouTube/TikTok), and proven retention methodology (Zettelkasten + spaced repetition). Anki requires manual work. Notion requires organization. MOOCs have no retention mechanism. We automate everything.

We'd love your feedback and are happy to answer any questions.

Best regards,
Diane, Anastasia, Thomas & Hugo

### Version 2: Story-Driven

```
Subject: Hack the Gap Submission: Recall - Stop Forgetting What You Learn

Hi Hack the Gap Team,

Three weeks ago, a philosophy student told us: "I watched 10 hours of YouTube videos on Kant, but I failed the exam. I couldn't remember anything."

This is the problem we're solving with Recall.

**Team**: Diane, Anastasia, Thomas, Hugo

**The Insight**: Gen Z students ARE learning—via YouTube, TikTok, podcasts—but they have no system for retention. They won't manually create flashcards (too much work), and traditional note-taking apps require too much organization. The educational system broke post-COVID, and students need a new solution.

**What We Built**: Recall turns passive content consumption into active retention. Students upload their syllabus, paste YouTube URLs they're already watching, and our AI:
1. Extracts atomic concepts from videos (20-35 per video)
2. Matches them to the student's learning goals (70%+ accuracy)
3. Auto-generates flashcards (one per concept)
4. Schedules spaced repetition reviews (proven methodology)

**The Magic Moment**: Upload syllabus → paste YouTube URL → see concepts match → unlock flashcard → review tomorrow → actually remember. Total time: 2 minutes.

**Current Status**:
- ✅ Live at recall.academy
- ✅ Full pipeline functional (syllabus → flashcards → reviews)
- ✅ 60-second processing time
- ✅ 70%+ matching accuracy
- 🎯 Validating retention improvement with test students

**Submission Links**:
- Product: https://recall.academy
- GitHub: https://github.com/hugoganet/hack_the_gap
- Metrics Doc: [Notion link]
- Demo Video: [Video link]

We built this in 48 hours because we believe Gen Z deserves a retention system that matches how they actually learn. We'd love your feedback.

Best,
Team Recall
(Diane, Anastasia, Thomas, Hugo)

### Version 3: Technical & Data-Driven

```
Subject: Hack the Gap Submission: Recall - 70%+ Concept Matching in 60 Seconds

Hi Hack the Gap Team,

Submitting Recall for Hack the Gap 2025.

**Team**: Diane, Anastasia, Thomas, Hugo

**Problem**: Students retain only 15% of educational content after 2 weeks. Root cause: passive consumption without active encoding.

**Solution**: AI-powered Zettelkasten system that automates the entire learning pipeline:
- Input: Syllabus (PDF/text) + YouTube URLs
- Processing: GPT-4 extracts atomic concepts (20-35 per video in 60s)
- Matching: AI matches concepts to learning goals (70%+ accuracy)
- Output: Auto-generated flashcards + spaced repetition schedule
- Result: Zero manual work, proven retention methodology

**Technical Stack**:
- Frontend: Next.js 15, React 19, TailwindCSS v4
- Backend: PostgreSQL (Supabase), Prisma ORM
- AI: OpenAI GPT-4 (prompt engineering, no fine-tuning)
- Infrastructure: Vercel (serverless), 60s avg processing time

**Key Innovation**: Truly atomic concept extraction—each concept = ONE flashcard (Zettelkasten methodology). Strict prompt engineering ensures quality without fine-tuning.

**Metrics (MVP)**:
- Processing time: 60 seconds per video
- Concept extraction: 20-35 concepts per video
- Matching accuracy: 70%+ (improving with feedback)
- Unlock rate: Tracked via gamification system
- Review completion: Spaced repetition algorithm functional

**Differentiators**:
1. 100% automated (vs. Anki's manual card creation)
2. Your own learning goals (vs. institutional curricula only)
3. Concept matching (vs. generic note-taking)
4. Gap analysis (vs. blind studying)
5. Global flexibility (works for any educational system)

**Submission Links**:
- Product: https://recall.academy
- GitHub: https://github.com/hugoganet/hack_the_gap
- Documentation: [Notion link]
- Demo: [Video link]

**Next Steps**: Validating retention improvement (80%+ vs. 20% baseline) with test students over 7 days.

Available for questions or live demo.

Best regards,
Team Recall
