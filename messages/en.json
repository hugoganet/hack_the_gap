      {
        "question": "Do I need to create flashcards manually?",

      },
      {
        "question": "How does spaced repetition work?",
        "answer": "The system schedules optimal review times based on **proven cognitive science**. You review each concept at increasing intervals (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, etc.). This moves information from short-term to long-term memory. Average review time: **3 min/day**."
      },
      {
        "question": "Can I edit or delete flashcards?",

      {
        "question": "Is this only for university students?",
        "answer": "**No.** Works for anyone with learning goals: university students, self-learners, bootcamp participants, online course students, language learners, knowledge workers. If you consume educational content, Recall helps you retain it."

      },
      {
        "question": "What languages are supported?",
        "answer": "Currently **English and French** for the interface. Content extraction works for **100+ languages** (our AI embeddings support cross-lingual matching). We're adding more interface languages post-MVP."
      },
      {
        "question": "How is this different from Anki or Quizlet?",
        "answer": "**Zero manual work.** Anki/Quizlet require you to create flashcards manually (students won't do it). Recall automatically extracts concepts from content you're already consuming and matches them to your learning goals. It's Zettelkasten methodology with AI automation."
