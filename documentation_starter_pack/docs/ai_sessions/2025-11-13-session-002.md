# AI Session: Product Vision Definition - Hack the Gap

## Summary

Completed first-time flow for product vision documentation. Discovered and clarified the core product concept: an AI-powered Zettelkasten system that auto-converts students' passive content consumption into active long-term retention via concept extraction, knowledge graph construction, and spaced repetition.

**Key Clarification:** Initially misunderstood as "auto-flashcard generator" but the founder clarified that Zettelkasten methodology is the engine (atomic concepts, bi-directional linking, knowledge graph) while students interact with simple UX (progress tracking, flashcard reviews, gap analysis). The graph is hidden backend for MVP.

**Critical Insight:** "Students won't manually create flashcards or organize notes anymore. The ONLY way spaced repetition works at scale is 100% automation from content they're already consuming passively."

## Decisions

1. **Product Name**: Temporary placeholder "hack the gap" - proper name TBD (considered: Retention, SyncGraph, ConceptFlow, MemoryMap)

2. **Zettelkasten as Backend Engine**: Use Zettelkasten principles (atomic notes, typed links, bottom-up knowledge graph) as backend architecture, but hide complexity from students in MVP. Power users (post-MVP) can view graph and export to Obsidian.

3. **MVP Scope (48-hour hackathon)**:
   - Pre-populate 3 public course syllabi (philosophy, biology, economics)
   - Process YouTube videos only (not TikTok, PDFs, articles)
   - Accept 20-30% concept matching error rate
   - Show confidence scores (>80% = learned, <80% = partial coverage)
   - Mobile-first web interface (no native apps)
   - Focus on ONE student journey end-to-end that works flawlessly

4. **Concept Matching Strategy**:
   - Three relationship types: Prerequisite, Related, Example-of
   - Use embedding similarity + explicit relationship prompting
   - GPT-4/Claude APIs for extraction (no fine-tuning)
   - Accept imperfection, show improvement roadmap

5. **Validation Criteria**:
   - 10 videos → 47+ concepts → 68%+ matched to syllabus
   - 3 test students → 80%+ retention after 24h vs 20% baseline
   - Concept extraction accuracy: 70%+ acceptable for MVP
   - Average review time: <5 min/day

6. **De-Risking Plan**:
   - Test concept extraction on 20 videos BEFORE hackathon
   - Partner with 3 students NOW for beta testing
   - Pre-download 5 public syllabi
   - Build feedback loop from day 1

## Actions

- [ ] Choose product name (brainstorm options: Retention, SyncGraph, ConceptFlow, MemoryMap, etc.)
- [ ] Test concept extraction on 20 videos to validate feasibility before hackathon
- [ ] Recruit 3 beta test students for hackathon validation
- [ ] Pre-download 5 public course syllabi (philosophy, biology, economics, psychology, history)
- [ ] Next prompt: Run User Stories flow (prompts/user_stories_prompt.md)
- [ ] Next prompt: Run Tech Stack flow (prompts/tech_stack_prompt.md)
- [ ] Next prompt: Run Data Schema flow (prompts/data_schema_prompt.md)

## Artifacts

- **Updated**: `project.yaml` - Added project name, summary, owner, tags, hackathon context
- **Created**: `docs/vision.md` - Complete product vision with:
  - One-liner thesis
  - Problem & opportunity (Gen Z retention gap, post-COVID shift)
  - Target personas (Primary: "The Motivated Struggler", Secondary: "The Power User")
  - Value proposition (Zettelkasten benefits without manual work)
  - MVP scope (48-hour hackathon boundaries)
  - Success criteria (hackathon, 30-day, 90-day metrics)
  - Risks & assumptions (7 critical assumptions, 7 top risks, de-risking plan)
- **Created**: This session log

## Notes

### Important Constraints

- **48-hour timeline**: Not production-ready, proof of concept only
- **No professor partnerships**: Use public syllabi for MVP
- **Accept AI imperfection**: 70% accuracy is defensible, show improvement path
- **One journey works perfectly**: Not breadth (many features) but depth (core pipeline proven)

### Critical Risks to Monitor

1. **Concept matching <50% accurate** → Students lose trust
2. **Retention doesn't improve within 7 days** → No value prop
3. **Review friction >5 min/day** → Students abandon
4. **Can't find public syllabi** → No seed data
5. **AI costs >$1/student/month** → Unit economics broken

### Key Architecture Decisions to Document

May need ADRs for:

- Choice of graph database (if using one)
- Spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2 vs simpler approach)
- AI provider selection (GPT-4 vs Claude vs hybrid)
- Content extraction pipeline architecture
- Concept matching algorithm design

### Target User Trigger Moments

Student has failed or nearly failed an exam despite watching hours of educational content. Realizes passive consumption ≠ learning. Wants to actually remember things but doesn't have time for manual flashcard creation.

**Magic Moment**: Watch a video → auto-convert to flashcards matched to course in 60 seconds → review tomorrow → ace a quiz on that material.

### Founder's Core Insight

"Obsidian is for knowledge workers. This is for Gen Z students who just want to pass exams without forgetting everything."

Students get Zettelkasten BENEFITS (retention, connections, understanding) without the WORK (manual note-taking, linking, curating).

### Next Session Prep

Before next session, founder should:

1. Review vision.md and confirm accuracy
2. Think about product name options
3. Consider which course syllabi to target (what do beta students need?)
4. Validate that 20 test videos are available for extraction testing

Next prompts to run (in order):

1. `prompts/user_stories_prompt.md` - Define MVP and next-stage user stories
2. `prompts/tech_stack_prompt.md` - Choose stack for 48h timeline
3. `prompts/data_schema_prompt.md` - Design entities and relationships
