# Changelog

## 2025-11-18 - Unlock Flow, Course Flashcards, Semantic UI, Landing i18n

### ✨ Features

- Confirm-to-unlock flow: users can confirm a concept match to unlock its flashcard immediately
  - API: `POST /api/concept-matches/confirm/:conceptMatchId` using `authRoute`
  - Service: `forceUnlockFlashcardAnswer` in `src/features/flashcards/unlock-service.ts`
  - UI: user match results dialog integrates the confirm action with loading state + toasts

- Course page first section redesigned to show all course flashcards
  - Answers are visible only when unlocked; locked cards show a CTA to ingest content
  - Files: `app/dashboard/courses/[courseId]/page.tsx`, `course-flashcards-view.tsx`, `src/components/flashcards/flashcard-card.tsx`

### 🎨 UI/UX

- Semantic color system for flashcards & reviews (Learning, Needs‑Work, Success) and growth progress gradient
  - See: `docs/implementation/us-0006-ui-semantic-colors.md`
  - Implemented in `app/globals.css` and applied across review/flashcard components

- Landing page i18n enhancements
  - Localized hero, beta banner, features, CTA
  - Files: `app/[locale]/page.tsx`, `messages/en.json`, `messages/fr.json`

### ⚠️ Notes

- Prefer Server Actions and `authRoute` for backend endpoints
- Organization-scoped dialogs remain informational only; user scope drives unlock behavior
